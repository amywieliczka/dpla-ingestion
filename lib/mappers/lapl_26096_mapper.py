class LAPL_26096Mapper(DublinCoreMapper):
    '''Map from the oai source records for LAPL collection 26096 (city
    directory) to the isShownAt & isShownBy properties.

    These are calculated from a portion of the identifier data per Adrian.
    The dc identifiers are of format:
    rescarta.lapl.org/jsp/RcWebImageViewer.jsp?doc_id=040428be-8b21-4de1-9b1e-3421068c0f1c/cl000000/20140507/00000002

    isShownAt:
    Use dc:identifier, but strip off "rescarta.lapl.org/jsp" and
    replace with "http://rescarta.lapl.org/ResCarta-Web/jsp"
    e.g.
    http://rescarta.lapl.org/ResCarta-Web/jsp/RcWebImageViewer.jsp?doc_id=040428be-8b21-4de1-9b1e-3421068c0f1c/cl000000/20140123/00000002

    isShownBy:
    Base URL is:
    http://rescarta.lapl.org/ResCarta-Web/servlet/RcWebThumbnail?obj_type=SERIAL_MONOGRAPH&pg_idx=0&obj_id=
    after obj_id= use the charracters in the dc:identifier field that begin with    ""c1"" to the end of the identifier to get the specific identifier and
    append

    An example of the complete URL is:
    http://rescarta.lapl.org/ResCarta-Web/servlet/RcWebThumbnail?obj_type=SERIAL_MONOGRAPH&pg_idx=0&obj_id=cl000000/20140507/00000027
