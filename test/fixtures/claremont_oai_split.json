           "A woman with a dark, up-swept hairstyle stands in profile with her arms outstretched. She wears a long red dress with a black trellis-like diamond pattern on the bodice and skirt. The outfit begins with a floral-patterned blouse in white, red, and black. The blouse has a high neck and long, narrow sleeves that reach over the hand with a flared edge. The blouse disappears beneath a full bodice, which continues to a tightly-gathered waistline emphasized by several black bands. The dress continues to the ground where a double layer of red ruffles spill out from underneath the hem of the dress. The back of the dress has a train of tightly-gathered folds which end in ruffles. In the distance is a small, black and white illustration of the rear view of the dress."
