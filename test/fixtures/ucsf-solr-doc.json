More than 20,000 internal documents were disclosed in the course of the litigation between Gallaher and the Cypriot company, Tlais Enterprises. This collection is a subset of those documents. During the trial, Gallaher was accused of \"complicity in facilitating worldwide smuggling, sanction-busting in Iraq, and the dumping of sub-standard cigarettes in Africa and Afghanistan,\" according to the British press.\r\n",
