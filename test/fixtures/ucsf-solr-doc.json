      "description": "From 2005 until 2008, Gallaher, a UK-based tobacco company which was later bought by Japan Tobacco International (JTI), spent three years in a bitter legal battle against its former Middle Eastern distributor. More than 20,000 internal documents were disclosed in the course of the litigation between Gallaher and the Cypriot company, Tlais Enterprises. This collection is a subset of those documents. During the trial, Gallaher was accused of \"complicity in facilitating worldwide smuggling, sanction-busting in Iraq, and the dumping of sub-standard cigarettes in Africa and Afghanistan,\" according to the British press.\r\n",
