        "The Delia Locke Diaries are part of the Locke-Hammond Family Papers. In addition to the diaries, these papers include a broad range of materials on the family and Lockeford, California, the town they founded in the 1850s. Delia (Hammond) Locke was the matriarch of the family. Born in 1832, she married Dr. Dean Jewett Locke and moved to California in 1855. That same year Delia began keeping a daily diary. Her thumbnail diaries from 1855 to 1918 have been digitized to create this online collection. The diaries provide a remarkable documentation of life in rural northern California in the 19th century. The daily happenings of Delia's life and the Lockeford community are recorded, including the activities of church and temperance organizations as well as the Mokelumne River Ladies' Sewing Circle. Nearly every entry begins with temperature recordings taken at sunrise.
